#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax: GUI / Hex editor
üóíÔ∏èNotes: 

The course taught us how to fix an MBR if the Signature is missing

Correct the MBR by replacing tampered with bytes, prime example of this is the MBR Signature 

0x55aa

If something else is corrupted in the MBR use Chat GPT but I don't think it will be, be careful not to go down a rabbit hole

Finding Hidden Partitions

A suspect may have made the partitions more difficult to find, but we can trace them down to find potentially hidden files

#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax: GUI - Instructions 

Finding Hidden Partitions
Simply load it into Autopsy and look on the evidence tree for drives that are marked as [Unallocated]Especially if its a gap in between other partitions

Check Partitions are legit
A suspect may mess with the partitions and change signatures to be different File Systems or Operating Systems As such, check for key things within each drive like the root drive. E.g files that are like $MFT will only be in NTFS, not any other file systems

Recover File Name based on $I and $R

Only Have the $I File

Locate the $Ixxxxx file.

Right-click the $Ixxxxx file and choose View in Hex Viewer.

The original filename and path are stored starting at byte offset 0x18 (24 bytes in).

Scroll down in the hex view and look for Unicode text containing the original file path and name.

The filename should be readable in ASCII or UTF-16LE format.

Throw into ChatGPT if its a LFN

If You Only Have the $R File

Identify the $Rxxxxx file which contains the actual deleted file.

Since the original filename is not stored in the $R file itself, you have two options:

Find a matching $Ixxxxx file (if available) in the same folder.

Recover and open the file to inspect its metadata.

Right-click the $Rxxxxx file and choose Export.

Use tools like ExifTool (for images), PE headers (for executables), or file properties in Windows to infer its original name.

Recover USB Disk traces

 When someone has used a USB disk it leaves behind some traces of it being plugged in within the registry. We can find how many USBs have been connected and all their metadata

Analyze Windows Artifacts

We may need to correlate multiple sources of evidence for one thing in particular, remember to check other sources if we were trying to determine something

Searches 

What searches and websites people have been doing

üî®Tool: lecmd.exe
üìÇLocation: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\ConnectedSearch\History
#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax: .\LECmd.exe -d %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\ConnectedSearch\History
üóíÔ∏èNotes: 

-d for directory -f for file

Look for Created / Modified Time and Search

Title indicates Site title or search query

_site files are websites visited 

_txt file are search queries

Opened Docs / lnk files

Recently opened files / folders

üî®Tool: LECmd.exe
üìÇLocation: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\
#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax: .\LECmd.exe -d %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Recent

üóíÔ∏èNotes:

Same as above

When a file is opened, it will create a lnk file in recent docs to the opened doc

This can show where the lnk file points to

Shell bags (UsrClass.dat)

Keeps track of what folders people have opened, window and view preferences, window positions, sorting etc

üî®Tool: shellbagsexplorer.exe
üìÇLocation: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\usrclass.dat

#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax for CLI: SBECmd.exe -d "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\usrclass.dat" --csv Results\

üóíÔ∏èNotes

Start with Shellbags explorer to get an idea of what was changed

if needed correlate that with registry events that each shellbag will tell you its location

Drag/ drop usrclass.dat into shellbags explorer

Everything you see in Shellbags is what the user has accessed

look for Settings / Control panel, Downloads, and libraries to find sus stuff

Prefetch Files

Windows performance feature that helps programs start faster. When an application is launched, Windows creates a .pf (prefetch) file in: üìÇ C:\Windows\Prefetch\ We can track what programs are run and how many times

üî®Tool: WinPrefetchView
üìÇLocation: %windir%\prefetch
#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax: GUI To make it analyze a different prefetch directory Options -> Advanced Options  > Path of Evidence

üóíÔ∏èNotes: 

By tracking what files are loading at start up this helps us find sus programs, malware and external devices

Hash value is in the exe name e.g zenmap.exe-[hashvalue].pf 

Thumbnails / Cache

This tracks previews of images that have been opened by a user, so if theyve deleted it, evidence may still remain 

üî®Tool: thumbcache_viewer
üìÇLocation: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer
#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax: GUI  

üóíÔ∏èNotes: 

Can open multiple db files all at once

Manually process, just browse through

Jump list 

Jump Lists are a Windows feature that tracks recently opened files, folders, and websites for specific applications (Word Excel etc). They allow users to quickly reopen recent items from the taskbar or Start menu. Files here have a .automaticDestinations-ms or .customDestinations-ms extension.

üî®Tool: JumpListExplore
üìÇLocation: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\CustomDestinations %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations
#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax: GUI  

üóíÔ∏èNotes: Double click on an item to get its full path, combine Local Path and Common path to make the full directory

Pinned Out will show if its pinned to the taskbar 

Created dates and Last modified dates here are important as it helps with timelines as well as shows if something has been opened more than once

User Libraries

User Libraries in Windows are virtual collections of folders that help organize and access files efficiently. Unlike normal folders, Libraries don‚Äôt store files directly but instead link to multiple locations.

üî®Tool: Notepad / Hex editor
üìÇLocation: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Libraries
#Ô∏è‚É£Syntax: GUI  

üóíÔ∏èNotes:  Library files are XML files that keep track of what folders to include in the library. We can track sus user activity from looking at Library files, they might reveal directories that have since been deleted.

Analyze Network Attacks
